## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Variables/ Coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance is AWD, spoiler_angle, and vehicle_weight. They produced the lowest p-values.
3. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Our p-valuue is less that 0.05% causing us to reject our null hypothesis due to the slope of our linear model is not zero.
5. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- Yes, this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively due to the R-squared value equaling 0.712. Which means 71% of the variablty of our dependent variable is explained in the linear model.
